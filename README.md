# Customer_data_Analysis
data analysis project Showcasing customer behavior analysis using Python,SQL and powerbi
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end Data Analytics workflow. The goal is to load, analyze, clean, and visualize data using Python, PostgreSQL, and Power BI. The workflow includes:

Loading and exploring the dataset

Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Cleaning and preprocessing the data

Running analytical SQL queries

Designing a Power BI dashboard

Deriving actionable insights

This project showcases strong analytical, technical, and visualization skills.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information related to [mention the theme—sales, products, customers, etc.].

Format: CSV

Source: Add source if available

Size: Add number of rows/columns

Project Steps
1️⃣ Load the Dataset (Python)

Imported the file using Pandas

Inspected structure using .head(), .info(), and .describe()

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Checked missing values and data types

Performed univariate & bivariate analysis

Identified patterns, trends, and outliers

Visualized key metrics using charts

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates

Treated outliers

Renamed columns for consistency

Converted data types

Exported cleaned dataset for SQL operations

4️⃣ SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Uploaded the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL and executed queries such as:

Aggregation (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Joins

Filtering and grouping

Ranking and window functions

This step helped derive deeper business insights using SQL.

5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

Imported cleaned data

Built an interactive dashboard including:

KPIs

Trend analysis

Filters/slicers

Category-wise breakdowns

Designed a user-friendly layout to support decision-making

6️⃣ Results & Insights

The project highlights key findings such as:

Important trends and patterns in the dataset

Performance indicators

Factors affecting outcomes

Data-driven insights that can guide business decisions
